## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸš€ My name is **John Keppe** and I am a tech-savvy individual and a Neural Novice seeking to transition into an entry-level tech role. I have spent the past week crafting websites like my Portfolio Site <a href:>https://keppe-john.github.io/portfolio-site/</a>. In regards to the Portfolio website I allowed Microsoft CoPilot to handle all of the heavy lifting as I began learning the ropes. It was an arduous project trying to encorporate a contact page using EmailJS and SEO using Google Search Console as I was learning to use HTML and CSS. I endured the setbacks and powered through all of the debugging to help create a very cool vaporware inspired responsive website. After successfully spending many hours on this project I was curious if I could actually build my own basic HTML/CSS website without any AI assistance. 

> ## ðŸ¤– Special Thanks

> I'd like to credit Microsoft Copilot for helping me brainstorm, debug, and build the portfolio project with style. Copilot was instrumental in guiding me
> through technical challenges, design brainstorming, and giving me confidence to take that idea further.

Using the Text app on my Chromebook I proceeded to slowly and methodically (testing every new element before moving on to the next one) build a simple resume webpage <a href:>https://johnkeppe-resume.neocities.org</a>. It took me a few hours of tweaking and debugging my errors but I finally got it working the way I wanted it to look and it looks marvelous, in my own opinion. I then proceeded to use Neocities to publish my "raw" resume HTML/CSS in order to showcase what I have learned working with AI on the Portfolio project or at least the basics of HTML/CSS at least.

> I then decided to style the HTML/CSS resume using Google Gemini and host it on my GitHub <a href:>https://keppe-john.github.io/resume/</a> and linked the Neocities to my GitHub enhanced version to show the differences. And eventhough Google Gemini added the bells and whistles the basic structure is all mine.





ðŸ§ª What I Learned: HTML, CSS layout tricks, favicon integration, debugging, GitHub Pages setup, Google Fonts, and SEO.
